# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview
###### I will help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting weather applicants will be successful in funded by Alphabet Soup. A CSV with more than 34,000 organizations will be used to create three Neural Network Model to find out which combination of input features, nodes and hidden layers give the best loss and accuracy test data.

# Results:
## Data Preprocessing
###### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- IS_SUCCESSFUL column
###### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- All variables except EIN, NAME, and USE_CASE 
###### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- EIN, NAME, and USE_CASE

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
###### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
###### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
